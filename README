Description: 
	This script generates menu structure via template. So you can just create menus for your bash programs  via this script and concentrates on fucntionality programming.

How it works:
	1) Fill tpl file with your menu structure:
		Template Example:
		 1){02}: MAIN MENU OPT 1
		 1){00}: MAIN MENU OPT 2
		 2){13}: SUB MENU 1. OPT 1
		 3){12}: SUB MENU 2. OPT 1
	
	"1)"   --- digit determines number of menu or submenu. Must be uniq for each menu\submenu
	"{13}" --- these two digits describe menu/submenu relationships. Firs (in our example it's 1) determine parent  menu\submenu, in our example it means that "SUB MENU 1. OPT 1" parent  is "MAIN MENU" which has number "1". Second digit (in our example - 3) determines  child meny\submenu. In our example it means that child for our menu is menu with number "3".

	2)clear.sh - will delete project created before.
	3) main.sh - will create project via tpl template file
